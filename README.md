# Python Cookbook

This repository contains the solutions' implementations in the book [Python Cookbook](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-cookbook-3rd/9781449357337/).

Each notebook implements one of the 15 chapters.

While the book contains the solutions, I believe the best way to learn is to try it yourself before looking at the answer and type the code yourself, not only reading it. 

Why am I doing this? I want to master one particular programming language, and given that I am more inclined towards data science, I selected Pyhton.

I hope you enjoy the repo as much as I enjoy building it!
